Certainly! To configure the model directly during the initialization process without having a separate `model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')` line, you can initialize the model while configuring Google Generative AI.

Here's the updated complete code with the `model` initialization included in the configuration process:

### Complete Python Script (`extract_and_qa.py`):

```python
# Install necessary libraries (uncomment the line below if you haven't installed them)
# !pip install google-generativeai beautifulsoup4 requests

import os
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import google.generativeai as genai
import urllib3

# Disable SSL warnings
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# Set your API key
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key

# Configure Google Generative AI and load the model
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')  # Directly initialize the model

# Function to fetch text from a URL with SSL verification disabled
def extract_text_from_url(url):
    """
    Fetches text from a webpage at the given URL, bypassing SSL verification.
    """
    response = requests.get(url, verify=False)  # Disable SSL verification
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Extract all text from the main content of the page
    texts = soup.stripped_strings
    extracted_text = "\n".join(texts)
    return extracted_text

# Function to save text to a file
def save_text_to_file(text, filename):
    """
    Saves the given text to a specified file.
    """
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(text)

# Function to load text from a file
def load_text_from_file(filename):
    """
    Loads text from a specified file.
    """
    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return file.read()

# Main process
def main():
    url = "https://example.com"  # Replace with the desired URL

    # Define file paths using os
    current_directory = os.getcwd()  # Get the current working directory
    output_filename = os.path.join(current_directory, "extracted_text.txt")  # Save to current directory

    # Step 1: Extract text from URL
    extracted_text = extract_text_from_url(url)

    # Step 2: Save the extracted text to a .txt file
    save_text_to_file(extracted_text, output_filename)

    # Step 3: Load the text from the file
    text_content = load_text_from_file(output_filename)

    # Step 4: Perform Q&A
    user_query = "Summarize the content of the page."  # You can change this to any question
    response = model.generate_content([f"Context: {text_content}\n\nQuestion: {user_query}"])

    # Print the response
    print("\nGemini 1.5 Flash Model's Response:")
    print(response.text)

# Run the main process
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Model Initialization During Configuration**:
   - The model is now initialized directly after the configuration with:
     ```python
     model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
     ```

2. **No Separate Initialization for Model**:
   - The model is available for use immediately after the configuration, so the `model` is ready to use throughout the script.

### How to Use:
1. **Install Libraries**:
   If you haven't already installed the necessary libraries, run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install google-generativeai beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

2. **Set Your API Key**:
   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your valid Google API key.

3. **Replace the URL**:
   Change the `url = "https://example.com"` to the webpage you want to scrape.

4. **Run the Script**:
   Save the script as `extract_and_qa.py`, and run it:
   ```bash
   python extract_and_qa.py
   ```

### Expected Output:
The script will:
1. Fetch text from the specified URL.
2. Save the text into `extracted_text.txt`.
3. Use the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate an answer to a question based on the extracted content.

For example, if the URL contains text like:
```
The Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi.
```
And the query is `"Summarize the content of the page."`, the response will be:
```
Gemini 1.5 Flash Model's Response:
The Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi.
```
